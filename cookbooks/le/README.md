# Cookbook to setup LogEntries for EY Cloud

This is an exploratory EY Cloud Cookbook to install and setup LogEntries when it is enabled as a Service.

Ultimately, the cookbooks/le folder will be a standalone recipe that customers will install into their environments via the `ey-recipe clone` command.

Updated to use newer version of Logentries. 

#### Requires Stable V4 Stack.
